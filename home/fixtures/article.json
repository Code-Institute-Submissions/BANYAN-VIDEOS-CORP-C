The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier should only come to London for a meeting scheduled next week if he was willing to discuss details on travel and cargo haulage, the spokesman said on Friday."

The repair-shop owner handed the laptop, allegedly left for repair by Biden and then abandoned, over to the FBI some time in December – but not before making four complete copies of the data as insurance, the former New York City mayor claimed, in a recent interview with The Daily Caller."

The majority of the 372,000 denied ballot requests, some 90 percent, were rejected as duplicates after voters mistakenly submitted repeat applications. Many did so unaware they had already agreed to be sent a ballot by mail during the state’s June 2 primary, as ballots for the prior race allowed voters to check a box to automatically receive a ballot for the general election as well. Ultimately, one in five applications have been turned down."

According to Lancet projections, India will have the largest working-age population prior to 2030, which will continue growing to reach peak levels before 2050. Despite a projected decline later on, India will still have more working-age adults than any country in the world by the end of the century."

        "article_content": "The coronavirus shopping frenzy has spilled over into government level as countries begin hoarding food amid fears that the pandemic’s effect on global supply chains could cause price hikes. Nations dependent on food imports seem to be the most concerned about shortages of agricultural goods as the number of coronavirus infections continues to rise. For example, Egypt, the largest importer of wheat globally, increased purchases by almost 40 percent year-on-year between July and August. The country’s officials earlier told Reuters that Cairo wants to have sufficient “essential goods” for no less than six months as a preemptive measure in the light of the ongoing pandemic."
